# Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate
# points.  The following "score" function will be used to calculate the
# score of a single roll of the dice.
#
# A greed roll is scored as follows:
#
# * A set of three ones is 1000 points
#
# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).
#
# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
#
# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
#
# * Everything else is worth 0 points.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# score([1,1,1,5,1]) => 1150 points
# score([2,3,4,6,2]) => 0 points
# score([3,4,5,3,3]) => 350 points
# score([1,5,1,2,4]) => 250 points
#
# More scoring examples are given in the tests below:
#
# Your goal is to write the score method.

def score(dice)
  score = 0
  # for each number 1 - 5
  (1..6).each do |n|
    # count how many are in the dice
    num = dice.count(n)
    # skip this if there aren't any numbers in the dice
    next if num == 0

    # for the ones and fives; this is dumb.
    if (n == 1)
      if (num >= 3)
        score += 1000
      end
      if (num < 3)
        score += num * 100
      else
        score += (num - 3) * 100
      end
    else # end ones
      # points for the triplets.
      if (num >= 3)
        score += n * 100
      end
      # points for the fives
      if (n == 5)
        multiplier = num
        if num >= 3
           multiplier = num - 3
        end
        score += multiplier * 50
      end
